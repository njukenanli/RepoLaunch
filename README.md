# `🚀 RepoLaunch`

*Turning Any Codebase into Testable Sandbox Environment*

RepoLaunch addresses the bottleneck of setting up execution environments by automating the process through an LLM-based agentic workflow.

## Launch Environment
Before getting started, please set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable. We use [tavily](https://www.tavily.com/) for LLM search engine support.

We provide an example input file `test-dataset.jsonl` and a run config `test-config.json` to help you quickly go through the launch process.

```shell
cd launch
pip install -e .

python -m launch.run --config-path test-config.json
```
