# `🚀 RepoLaunch Agent`

*Turning Any Codebase into Testable Sandbox Environment*

Paper: [RepoLaunch: Automating Build&Test Pipeline of Code Repositories on ANY Language and ANY Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.05026)

RepoLaunch now supports 
- All mainstram languages : C, C++, C#, Python, Java, Node.js (JS & TS), Go, Rust.
- Building on linux images, android images, windows images.


## Notifications

**[29/Apr/2026]** Add Android platform support. The Android images are built from Linux arch images, which can run on Linux docker and Docker Desktop.

**[28/Mar/2026]**

RepoLaunch now uses LiteLLM to:
  - ensure compatibility with all mainstream LLM providers
  - enable local LLM deployment for agentic training (RFT, RL) based on launch results

RepoLaunch now still uses traditional Thought-Action format for agent actions, because
  - We find that many smaller open-source LMs cannot handle tool call field well.
  - Thought Action in pure text content field ensures best compatibility and feasibility for smaller open-source LMs.

**[01/Mar/2026]** Thanks [GLM-5 Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15763) for using RepoLaunch to create executable environment for agentic RL!

## Launch your Repository

To use RepoLaunch Agent to launch your repository, please refer to [Development.md](./docs/Development.md)

RepoLaunch can:
1) Install all dependencies and build the repository, delivered as a docker image;
2) Organize the command to rebuild the repository inside the container after modifications;
3) Organize command to test the repository, write a parser to parse test output into testcase-status mapping, and optionally find per-testcase running command.

The basic workflow of RepoLaunch agent is as follows:

## Contributing

### Contributing to RepoLaunch Source Codes

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md::Contributing to RepoLaunch Source Codes](./CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-repolaunch-source-codes).

### Use RepoLaunch to Create New Software Engineering Benchmarks

So far the major contribution of RepoLaunch is to create tasks for [SWE-bench-Live](https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live), where the creation of SWE-tasks is based purely on scraping GitHub issues and PRs. Now SWE-bench-Live datasets have been used for benchmarking of LLMs and coding agents, and training (SFT/RL) of coding LLMs. 

We encourage new research projects to design new kinds of SWE-tasks for LLM benchmarking and training, with task creation automated by RepoLaunch.

### Improve Agentic Repository Build and Management Task based on RepoLaunch

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md::Future Directions to Study](./CONTRIBUTING.md#future-directions-to-study).
